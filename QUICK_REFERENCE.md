## 🎤 **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**
```
"In Sierra Leone, finding emergency medical care is difficult - 
no centralized database, unreliable internet, no way to check 
if hospitals have beds.

MedFind Salone solves this. It's an offline-first mobile app 
that finds the nearest hospital with available beds, oxygen, 
and surgeons - even without internet.

12 hospitals now, scaling to 100+. Target: 10,000 users in 
3 months. Every second saved could be a life saved."
```
